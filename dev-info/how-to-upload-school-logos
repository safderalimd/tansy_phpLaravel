How to upload school logos for different schools:

1. The name of the image must be 'logo.png'.
2. The type of the image must be 'png'.
3. The image size must be set to 150px width and 130px height, otherwise it will be resized to these dimentions.

4. The location on the server is:
    - the site path is: '/vaw/www/tansycloud.com' or '/vaw/www/tansycloud.dev'
    - the logo path in the site is: '/storage/uploads/DOMAIN_FOLDER/school-logo/logo.png'

5. The folder and file permissions:
    - the user and user group should be 'www-data:www-data' (The apache web server user)
    - the permissions should be 775

    When uploading you will be root user, so the web server may not have access to uploaded files. You can change user group with these commands:

        chown www-data:www-data logo.png
        chown www-data:www-data DOMAIN_FOLDER

        chmod 775 logo.png
        chmod 775 DOMAIN_FOLDER
